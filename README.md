## Introduction

Welcome to Project Renegan, where innovation meets public safety! Our mission is to revolutionize crime detection and law enforcement efficiency by Geo-Tagging privately owned cameras. In collaboration with law enforcement agencies, we aim to create a comprehensive system that not only tracks camera locations but also facilitates quick access to crucial video footage during investigations.

Explore our cutting-edge solution that combines real-time incident analysis, precise location tracking, and seamless integration with AWS S3 for secure data storage. Join us on this journey to make communities safer and contribute to a smarter, more connected future.

Stay tuned for updates, and let's build a safer world together!
